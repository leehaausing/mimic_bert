he had been living at  for the day prior to admission.  he is a social drinker and has a 40-pack-year smoking history; although, he quit smoking 20 years ago.  physical examination on presentation:   initial physical examination revealed temperature was 1 degrees fahrenheit, heart rate was 83, blood pressure was 124/42 (following administration of 3 liters of normal saline), respiratory was 24, and his oxygen saturation was 100% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  his heart had a regular rate and rhythm.  there were normal first and second heart sounds.  there was a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, and there were no rubs or gallops. his lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  his abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, and there were hypoactive bowel sounds.  he had a palpable bypass graft pulse,  dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally; and his surgical incision was clean, dry, and intact.  please note that the above examination was done by the vascular surgery team, which was the team that was initially planning to admit the patient to the hospital.  pertinent laboratory data on presentation:  on initial laboratory evaluation the patient had a white blood cell count of 7, hematocrit was 2, and platelets were 282,  his pt was 5, ptt was 7, and inr was   his serum chemistries revealed sodium was 136, potassium was 4, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 25, blood urea nitrogen was 53, creatinine was 2, and blood glucose was   his calcium was 2, magnesium was 4, and phosphate was   blood cultures drawn on admission were pending, but ultimately negative.  a urine culture taken on admission was initially pending, but ultimately grew out yeast.  a sputum culture taken on admission was also initially pending, but ultimately also grew out yeast.  radiology/imaging:  his admission chest x-ray demonstrated stable prominence of the right main pulmonary artery; no focal areas of consolidation; overall stable appearance of the chest compared with a  study.  no radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure or pneumonia.  his admission electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm, nonspecific inferior/lateral t wave changes, low qrs voltages in the limb leads, and t wave changes in v5 and v6 when compared with an electrocardiogram dated .  an initial abdominal ct was a limited noncontrast examination that demonstrated diffuse vascular calcifications.  no evidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or free fluid, incompletely imaged coronary artery calcification, a simple left renal cyst, sigmoid diverticulosis, and an enlarged and partially calcified prostate gland.  hospital course by system:    cardiovascular:  the patient was initially admitted to the vascular intensive care unit with hypotension, decreased urine output, and acute renal failure; most likely secondary to a presumed gram-negative urosepsis (although there were never any positive culture data to confirm this diagnosis).  while boarding in the medical intensive care unit on the night of admission, the patient had a sudden cardiorespiratory arrest.  he was resuscitated with epinephrine, lidocaine, and direct current cardioversion times four.  he was also intubate for airway protection.  following these measures, the patient returned to a sinus rhythm with a systolic blood pressure of approximately 100; the total time elapsed from the beginning of the arrest to the return of a pulse was approximately 16 minutes.  he subsequently required double pressors to maintain his blood pressure.  an echocardiogram performed at the bedside demonstrated a trivial pericardial effusion and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 20% to 25% in the setting of tachycardia and a hyperdynamic right ventricle; suggesting elevated right-sided filling pressures.  although the definitive etiology of this arrest remained unknown, the most likely trigger was a non-q-wave myocardial infarction, as his troponin values were elevated to greater than 50 following his arrest.  a repeat echocardiogram done on  demonstrated mild left atrial dilation, an ejection fraction of 15% to 20%, resting regional wall motion abnormalities including inferior, mid, and apical left ventricular akinesis, depressed right ventricular systolic function, and moderate mitral regurgitation.  compared with the prior study of ; the left ventricular function was unchanged.  there was moderate mitral regurgitation, and the right ventricular function appeared worse.  on , the patient was loaded with amiodarone and was subsequently started on oral amiodarone.  the following day, he was started on heparin intravenously given his elevated serum troponin to greater than 50; this medication was continued for 72 hours.  given his elevated troponins and non-q-wave myocardial infarction, the patient was a candidate for cardiac catheterization.  after discussions between the medical intensive care unit team and the patient's family, however, the decision was made to not pursue further invasive procedures given that the patient had been made do not resuscitate/do not intubate following the resuscitation mentioned above, and his family no longer wished for aggressive resuscitating measures.  by , he was off pressors and he was restarted on a beta blocker and ace inhibitor at low doses.  on the evening of , the patient complained of substernal chest pain that was relieved by npg sl and morphine.  he also had st segment depressions in v2 and v3 that reverted to baseline after the resolution of his pain. therefore, the patient was again started on heparin; although, this was discontinued on  when the patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes.  he again had substernal chest pain on ; although, he had no electrocardiogram changes, and he again ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes.  by hospital day four, the patient began to develop evidence of congestive heart failure given his aggressive fluid resuscitation, and gentle diuresis with furosemide was begun. by the time of his transfer to the general medicine service on , the patient was still significantly volume overloaded following his aggressive fluid resuscitation in the medical intensive care unit.  therefore, he was continued on the program of gentle diuresis given that he was having signs and symptoms of right-sided congestive heart failure.  he achieved adequate diuresis by the time of his discharge to rehabilitation, as his oxygen saturation was greater than 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.    infectious disease/sepsis:  the patient was started on gentamicin and piperacillin/tazobactam in addition to the levofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin he was already taking for right lower extremity cellulitis prior to admission for empiric coverage of a presumed gram-negative urosepsis, and he was aggressively hydrated with intravenous fluids.  on , his levofloxacin and metronidazole was discontinued, and he was started on fluconazole given the growth of yeast on urine culture.  he was taken off of gentamicin on hospital day three, and his fluconazole was discontinued on hospital day five (as per the infectious disease service).  he was taken off of vancomycin on , and his piperacillin/tazobactam was discontinued on .  despite the presumption of a gram-negative urosepsis precipitating this admission, the patient did not have any positive blood or urine cultures aside from the growth of yeast in two urine cultures noted above.  he remained afebrile both before and after discontinuation of his antibiotics, and he was found to be clostridium difficile negative on .    pulmonary:  as noted above, the patient was intubated and he was extubated on .  he subsequently developed wheezing and mild hypoxia; most likely secondary to cardiac asthma and fluid overload in the setting of his aggressive fluid resuscitation.  he was gently diuresed toward the end of his hospitalization, and by the time of his he was maintaining an oxygen saturation of greater than 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula, intermittent ipratropium nebulizers, and chest physical therapy for clearance of his respiratory secretions.    renal:  the patient presented with acute renal failure and prerenal azotemia that rapidly resolved following fluid resuscitation.  by the time of discharge, his serum creatinine was stable and at his preadmission baseline.    nutrition:  the patient was found to be profoundly malnourished with a serum albumin of 8 on admission.  once he was extubated and taking orals, he performed poorly on a modified barium swallowing study and was started on a thin liquid, ground-solid diet with whole medication tablets, small bites and sips, upright posture with meals, and aspiration precautions.  he was also given promod shakes with and between meals for nutritional supplementation of his heart-healthy/diabetic diet.    vascular:  the patient's operative incisions and foot ulcers continued to heal throughout this admission.  he was started on an multivitamin, vitamin c, and zinc for improved wound healing.    hematology:  the patient was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells on  to maintain a hematocrit of greater than 30 given his history of severe coronary artery disease.  his hematocrit subsequently remained stable.  condition at discharge:  condition on discharge was stable.  discharge status:    rehabilitation facility.  discharge diagnoses:    cardiorespiratory arrest.    non-q-wave myocardial infarction.    acute renal failure.    coronary artery disease with diffuse 3-vessel disease; right-dominant, status post proximal left circumflex stent in  with occlusion of distal left circumflex; status post right coronary artery stent on  (no percutaneous coronary intervention to 99%, distal left circumflex, 80% small proximal left anterior descending artery, 80% small distal left anterior descending artery).    congestive heart failure (with an ejection fraction of 15% to 20%).    type 2 diabetes with neuropathy.    hypertension.    diverticulosis (found on colonoscopy in ).    alzheimer's dementia.   history of gastrointestinal bleed (while the patient was taking eptifibatide).   cardiac risk factors (with a baseline creatinine of 4 to 6).   history of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas growth in wound cultures.   severe peripheral vascular disease;

      " pharmacy note  antihypertensives    assessment:    ms  is a 23 year-old woman with h/o sle, hypertension requiring    multiple medications; she is also in dialysis-dependent esrd.  she is    currently in the  with uncontrolled emergent hypertension (sbp    200 s).  current bp meds are labetalol iv drip at 6 mg/min, clonidine    patch 3 mg/day (apply weekly), hydralazine iv q6h; most home bp meds    are being held given nausea; diuretics are not an option given that she    makes no urine.  labetalol infusion is delivering quite a bit of volume    (~ 60 ml/hr = 1400 ml/day).    recommendation:           labetalol  great medication for this patient as it is not    cleared renally and is not known to effect cerebral perfusion pressures    or heart rate with bp drop  alpha/beta blocker.  therefore, continue    labetalol drip as main means of controlling bp and supplement with    boluses as needed every 3, every 4 hours or every 6 hours  more    frequent checks would be ideal initially.  specifically, i would    recommend a dose range of 10 to 20 mg administered q4h:prn to start.    goal blood pressure to be determined by the icu team and/or neuro    service.  when able, begin to add on oral labetalol with a goal of    achieving the home dose of 900 mg tid.           clonidine  great medication for this patient for similar    reasons as labetalol above  cerebral alpha-2 agonist.  continue    clonidine (patch is currently on patient) and is applied weekly to    deliver 3 mg per day.  if bp remains uncontrolled consider    supplementing with oral clonidine 1 to 2 mg tid on a schedule    during this critical time.  prn administration of this med during    critical times when nothing else works is often beneficial  again hr    or cerebral perfusion pressure are not known to be affected with bp    drops.           hydralazine  also a favorable medication in renal    dysfunction  arterial and venous dilation.  continue iv and consider    switching to home oral regimen as tolerated.             given that this patient is in esrd, risks of renal    failure are not as concerning  ace and arbs both recommended for esrd    patients by nkf/kdoqi.  when able, would suggest reinstituting this med    of course with guidance from renal service.           calcium channel blockers (ccb)  when reinstitute ms  ium channel blocker (nifedipine)  be sure to prescribe the xl or    extended release preparation.  immediate release preparation is    associated with abrupt drops in bp and rebound tachycardia    particularly mi and/or stroke events.  such events are    reported/associated only with dihydropyridine (e.g. oral nifedipine    oral or nicardipine); little risk appears to exist with    non-dihydropyridine ccb; no real risk with extended release nifedipine    preparation or iv nicardipine.  as discussed on rounds, should the team    decide to choose a ccb, nicardipine is an adjunctive option with    labetalol drip.  nicardipine is administered as an iv continuous    infusion ~ 5 to 3 mcg/kg/minute (5 to 15 mg/hr) and dose come with a    considerable cost.  this  has been incorporated into the     code stroke protocol along with labetalol.           of course, reinstitute home bp meds when able.    please contact me with questions.     , pharmd    pager  \n",
