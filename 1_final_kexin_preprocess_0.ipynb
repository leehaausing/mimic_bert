Also with a Urinary Tract\\nInfection.\\n\\nAssessment/Plan: 64 year-old male w/ history of lung ca s/p\\nright pneumonectomy, severe COPD, recent trach and  \\nrehab with a flutter 2:1, leukocytosis, hypotension and UTI.\\n.\\n Hypotension:   have been due to infection from UTI vs.\\nsymptomatic tachycardia.\\nResponded to aggresive fluid resusciation and rate control.\\nRemained normotensive for the rest of hospitalization. Of note,\\nhis blood pressures were lower in left arm and family reported\\nthat this is a  problem for him.\\n.\\n Atrial Flutter: He has a known history of paroxysmal Atrial\\nFibrillation.His was initially in rapid Atrial Fluuter with 2:1\\nconduction. This initially responded to diltiazem. On hopital\\nday #2 he went back into artial flutter and in consultation with\\nElectrophysiology service Amiodarone was initiated and diltiazem\\nwas stopped (as he had been on Amiodarone for 5 years in the\\npast, and it had to be discontinued  due to bradycardia\\nwhen lopressor was added).  He remained in sinus rhythm for the\\nremainder of the hospitalization. Plan is continue Amiodarone\\n400mg TID x 1 week then 400mg  x 1 week then 200mg po QD\\nthereafter.  He is to avoid beta blockers and calcium channel\\nblockers.\\n\\n Respiratory Failure:  His chest x-ray showed no evidence of\\nPneumonia. Due to a notable trach leak, his trach was changed by\\nrespiraotory. An interventional Pulmonolgy consult was obtained\\ndue to concern of cuff leak and possible tracheomalacia.  Dr.\\n recommended keeping the cuff pressures low with a cuff\\nleak to prevent further tracheamalacia-- he would be willing to\\nchange the trach to a foam-filled trach ( tube) in the\\nfuture if the cuff leak is interfering with the ability to\\nventilate.  He was continued on PS as tolerated with periods of\\nrest on Assist Control.\\n.\\n Klebsiella Urinary Tract Infection: He was initally started\\non ceftriaxone which was changed to levofloxacin but given\\nhistory of heart block to levo, he was changed to Bactrim to\\ncomplete a 7-day course for complicated UTI. The Urine Culture\\ngrew Klebsiella which is sensitive to Bactrim.His foley catheter\\nwas discontinued.\\n.\\nAcute Blood Loss Anemia: His baseline hematocrit was 28- He\\nwas initially hemo-concentrated, but then on hospital day #3,\\nhis hematorcit dropped to   due to extensive bleeding from\\nsite of central line, he was transfused 2 UPRBC and had an\\nappropriate bump in his hematocrit. He was noted to have \\nguaiac positive stool, but this was in the setting of extensive\\nbleeding from Internal Jugular catheter site into his\\ntrach/mouth. His hematocrit should be followed as an outpatient,\\nand his stools should be continued to check guauic studies for\\ntrace blood.\\n.\\n Bleeding from Central Line site. He is maintained on coumadin\\nfor Atrial Fibrillation and his inital INR was therapeutic.\\nAfter IJ placement, he had continued oozing from IJ site leading\\nto anemia with hct    He was given FFP and vitamin K (5 mg\\niv) to reverse his coagultopathy. He should be restarted on\\ncoumadin for Atrial Fibrillation at rehab.\\n.\\n Diabetes Mellitis: He was continued on glargine and regular\\ninsulin sliding scale. His sugars were in good control.\\n.\\n Pain/anxiety/depression:\\nHe was continued on his outpatient doses of Fentanyl\\n75mcg/q72hours, Haldol for anxiety 5mg hs, 2mg 8am/2pm, 1mg\\ntid/prn, and paxil.   His pain is from his scaral decubitus\\nulcer.\\n.\\n Sacral Decubitus: He was seen by wound care nurse and\\ncontinued on DSD for sacral wound.\\n.\\n Left Upper Extremity Swelling: He had U/S which showed...\\n.\\n Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: He was given lasix prn to\\nkeep fluid even.\\n.\\nCode: FULL\\n.\\n Dispo: Discharged to  Rehab.\\n.\\n Access: The Right Internal Jugular Vein triple lumen\\ncatheter was not discontinued per  request. This was\\nplaced on .\\n------\\nOutstanding issues on discharge:\\nThe pt was started on coumadin at 5 mg qday on day of\\ndischarge .  Please monitor his INR and adjust dose\\naccordingly.\\nThe pt has a swollen L arm and had U/S on day of discharge to\\nr/o clot. No read has been given yet. Please call  to\\nfollow this up.
